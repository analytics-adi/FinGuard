# 🛡️ FinGuard — Real-Time Transaction Fraud Detection

## 📌 Overview
Financial fraud causes significant losses for banks and fintech companies.  
**FinGuard** is an end-to-end data science project that detects fraudulent financial transactions by learning abnormal transaction patterns and delivering **real-time predictions** through a deployed web application.

This project demonstrates how fraud analytics systems are built and deployed in real-world environments.
